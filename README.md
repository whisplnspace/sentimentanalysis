This repository contains a sentiment analysis  that leverages a pre-trained deep learning model to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The project demonstrates how to use transfer learning to apply a pre-trained NLP model, fine-tune it on a specific dataset, and evaluate its performance.
